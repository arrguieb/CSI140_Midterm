                <p>The Philippines is a country located in South Asia that is facing multiple significant climate justice issues, such as, floods, landslides, and erosion that pollutes the water in result of rising sea levels, higher temperatures, and increased frequency of typhoons and extreme weather events</p>

                <h3>Solutions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Accountability</h4>
                        <p>Even though the country's contribution to wolrd greenhouse gas emissions is small compared to the G20, studies show that the country's emissions increased by 114 percent from 1990 to 2017, largely due to the energy and industrty sectors</p>
                        <p>The Philippines need to take steps towards climate crisis mitigation, including banning practices such as deforestation, illegal mining and logging, and plastic waste pollution, which are known to harm the environment.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Renewable Energy</h4>
                        <p>The USAID supports the deployment of advanced energy sector technology and works to improve the performance and resilience of energy utilities. In partnership with the Philippines' Department of Energy and Energy Regualtor Commisision, USAID is working to improve the environment for private investment and competition in the energy sector.</p>
                        <p>This renewable energy is projected to avoid 69.7 million metric tons in carbon dioxide equivalent emissions over 15 years.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Natural Climate Solutions</h4>
                        <p>The USAID supports natrual climate solutions through reforestation, improved rice production technology, and improved management of livestock and livestock waste</p>
